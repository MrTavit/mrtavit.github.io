# Welcome to my home page!

## This is the beginning of me learning to become a web developer.

This website was made using the Bootstrap CSS framework.

On the home page is a picture of myself, and some information about me. Within the navigation bar at the top of the screen there are links to the other pages on my website. If accessed from a small window the links will collapse into a dropdown menu.

The menu options are:
* About - this is the home page.
* Contact
* Portfolio

The current page will be highlighted in bold.

Clicking on 'Contact' will open my contact page where you can leave me a message. There are 3 forms, 'Name', 'Email', and 'Leave a message'. Clicking submit will refresh the page. *Currently, leaving a message will not actually save the message.* 

The final page is my 'Portfolio' page, where there are images that link to projects that I have currently deployed. When clicking on an image the window will redirect to the project shown. *Placeholder images will link to the top of the window until more projects are added in their place*
